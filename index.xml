      <description>This is my first post on the blog I wanted to create a place for me to talk about weekly or monthly progress made in my free time. As of right now, I am curretnly working on a project called spotbot, and studying for a certification called PJPT along side my brother, a cybersecurity professional. Instead of flooding my LinkedIn with posts about things like this, I thought I would blog about it instead and maybe post about big milestones in this blog on said LinkedIn.</description>
