      <description>Introduction Tokenization is a process that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive data, typically using a reference token that maps back to the original data. This is a process that is part of secrets management, the process of secretly storing, accessing, and managing digital secrets.
In my pursuit of learning more about DevSecOps, I wanted to get my hands on some Kubernetes work to learn about the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</description>

Initially, we had issues with the application running properly on Linux. I took the initiative to test the entire application on a virtual machine running Debian to ensure everything functioned correctly in a Linux environment. Here&amp;rsquo;s how the process went:</description>

      <description>Spotbot 1 Spotbot is a Discord bot that scrapes Spotify links from a Discord channel and automatically adds the songs to a set Spotify playlist. Users must set up and host the bot on their own hardware. To authenticate, user login with a Spotify account and set all parameters in a JSON file. In its original state the bot utilizes files for storage of links sent in the chat.

      <description>This is my first post on the blog I wanted to create a place for me to talk about weekly or monthly progress made in my free time. As of right now, I am curretnly working on a project called spotbot, and studying for a certification called PJPT along side my brother, a cybersecurity professional. Instead of flooding my LinkedIn with posts about things like this, I thought I would blog about it instead and maybe post about big milestones in this blog on said LinkedIn.</description>
