A few friends and I are working on an open-source project called SpotBot. The best description of the project is &ldquo;an overengineered shared playlist.&rdquo; While working on this project, things became a little convoluted. Initially, we had issues with the application running properly on Linux. I took the initiative to test the entire application on a virtual machine running Debian to ensure everything functioned correctly in a Linux environment. Here&rsquo;s how the process went:">

<p>A few friends and I are working on an open-source project called <a href="https://karltrowbridge1.github.io/projects/spotbot/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpotBot</a>. The best description of the project is &ldquo;an overengineered shared playlist.&rdquo; While working on this project, things became a little convoluted. Initially, we had issues with the application running properly on Linux. I took the initiative to test the entire application on a virtual machine running Debian to ensure everything functioned correctly in a Linux environment. Here&rsquo;s how the process went:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the VM</li>
<li>Delete the old repo that was locally cloned from GitHub</li>
<li>Enter the VENV</li>
<li>Re-clone the repo that needs to be tested</li>
<li>Move the configuration file to the directory</li>
<li>Begin testing</li>
</ol>
<p>I imgaine anyone who works in automation is disappointed.</p>
<p>Docker quickly became the obvious choice to automate this entire process. Through this endeavor, I learned the benefits of Docker&rsquo;s lightweight nature, the usability of volumes for a better user experience, and how application concerns often extend beyond the end user.</p>
<p>A link to the SpotBot Docker testing container can be found <a href="https://github.com/karltrowbridge1/spotbotDocker"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Initially, the container I created utilized Ubuntu, which was very straightforward to work with. Many of the tools the application relies on were already included in the image, making build times fast.</p>
<p>After sharing my work with a friend more experienced with Docker, he provided feedback that shaped the lessons in this post. He suggested using Alpine or Manjaro Linux instead.</p>
<p>I transitioned to Alpine, which required modifying several aspects of the <code>Dockerfile</code>. While this added steps to install additional packages during the build process, it resulted in a container that was much more efficient to run and deploy.</p>
<h2 id="volumes">
  Volumes

</h2>
<p>To run SpotBot, the administrator needs to configure and provide a JSON file containing setup information. In my first attempt at creating the container, I copied this file into the container via the <code>Dockerfile</code>. However, my friend pointed out that this approach was not best practice. Instead, utilizing a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volume</a> allows users to build the image once and run the container with the flexibility to update setup files without rebuilding.</p>
<p>After adjusting the configuration, users can now freely add or change a setup file on the fly via a volume.</p>
<p>For ease of use, I created a directory, <code>/app/setup/</code>, for the volume to mount. The container&rsquo;s run command now requires a volume declaration:
<code>-v /path/to/local/dirContainingSetupFile:/app/setup</code></p>
<p>This allows the startup shell script to reference the <code>setup.json</code> file provided by the user.</p>

<p>An interestign issue with the flask applicaiton used for authentication with the Spotify servers was made apparant when the prompt I had created to close the application after authentication got burried by logs from the flask application.</p>
<p>To terminate the process after successful authentication, I used a <code>read</code> statement in the bash script. In classic primitive programming fashion, the application closes when the user hits <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>When running SpotBot on bare metal, the webserver is stopped via a keyboard interrupt. While this approach works well enough, it’s a low-priority item on the to-do list. However, creating this Docker container taught me the importance of thinking beyond just the end user to consider system integration and automation. Where a keyboard interrupt worked manually, automated systems may struggle with such a design. This was a small but valuable takeaway.</p>

</h2>
<p>Creating and using this container for fast testing has been an excellent time-saver and learning experience. The ability to spin up and tear down an entire environment in seconds is fantastic. Passing this container between developers has significantly reduced the &ldquo;it works on my machine&rdquo; scenarios that lead to broken code being pushed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this simple container can serve as a platform to jumpstart a production container, simplifying administration for end users.</p>
<p>Enjoying this project has inspired me to explore creating a CI/CD pipeline for SpotBot. One step at a time.</p>
